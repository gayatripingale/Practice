# Instructions

Using the Numbers API, create an application that takes in a user's inputs and returns a number fact based upon it.

See types at: http://numbersapi.com/

e.g.: http://numbersapi.com/43/math

### Hints:

* The URL to make your request to must have ?json at its end so that the data format returned is JSON. The default response is pure text.

* Make sure to read through the documentation when creating your application. Some types require more or less data than others.
